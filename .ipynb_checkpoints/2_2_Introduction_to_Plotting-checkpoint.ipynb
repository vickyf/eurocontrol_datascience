    "## Introduction\n",
    "Matplotlib is a library for producing publication-quality figures. mpl (for short) was designed from the bottom-up to serve dual-purposes. First, to allow for interactive, cross-platform control of figures and plots, and second, to make it very easy to produce static raster or vector graphics files without the need for any GUIs. Furthermore, mpl -- much like Python itself -- gives the developer complete control over the appearance of their plots, while still being very usable through a powerful defaults system."

    "Most plotting ocurs on an **``Axes``**.  The axes is effectively the area that we plot data on and any ticks/labels/etc associated with it.  Usually we'll set up an Axes with a call to **``subplot``** (which places Axes on a regular grid), so in most cases, ``Axes`` and ``Subplot`` are synonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ``Axes`` has an **``XAxis``** and a **``YAxis``**.  These contain the ticks, tick locations, labels, etc.  In this notebook, we'll mostly control ticks, tick labels, and data limits through other mechanisms, so we won't touch the individual ``Axis`` part of things all that much."

This mailing list is an excellent resource of information with many friendly members who just love to help out newcomers. The number one rule to remember with this list is to be persistant. While many questions do get answered fairly quickly, some do fall through the cracks, or the one person who knows the answer isn't available.
