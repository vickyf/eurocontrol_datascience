    "\n",
    "We can do many things to manipulate strings. If we want to access a character we can type `str[index]`, where index is the index of the character in the string. (Keep in mind programming languages start indexing at 0, not 1). If you enter a negative index, you can get count back from the last character (-1 is the last character, -2 the second to last â€¦).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a substring by using slicing: `str[i1:i2]` will return the substring from i1 up to but not including i2. You can query the length of a string with len(str). If you leave i1 or i2 blank, the substring will respectively start from the first character or go through to the last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "String concatenation uses the + operator. \"`Hello\" + \" \" + \"world`\" will result in \"Hello world\".\n",

To create a counter we first need to import 'collections'. Then you can create a new counter with the command: `collections.Counter(iterable)`. \n",

    "Lambda functions are anonymous function that can be used inline. This makes them very usefull for simple one time functions. Their basic syntax is: `lambda arguments: expression`. Notice a lambda function doesn't have a return statement. It can take multiple arguments seperated by commas but only one expression. Often a lambda function is used when a function is needed as an argument for another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of such functions are map and filter. They both take a function and a sequence as arguments. Map will then perform the function on each element of the sequence and output these results in a new sequence. Filter needs the function to output a boolean value. It will output a sequence with the elements of the first sequence that returned `True` in the function. To output the new sequence, it can be turned into a list by surrounding it with list().\n",
